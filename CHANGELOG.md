### Security
- Updated Go toolchain to 1.26.4, patching standard library vulnerabilities.

- Updated critical Python dependencies (cryptography, python-multipart, starlette) in uv.lock to resolve structural security flaws.

### Changed
- Modularized monolithic Helm charts into isolated Kubernetes resources for Postgres, Redis, Redpanda, and Console.
- Sanitized AWS and OCI Terraform configurations to strictly adhere to IaC standards.
- Segmented GitHub Actions into isolated, dedicated pipelines: security, format, and test.
- Enforced strict static analysis gates via golangci-lint (compiled vs Go 1.26.4 to resolve mismatch), rustfmt, and ruff.
- Parallelized Go, Rust, and Python test execution to optimize CI pipeline duration.

### Fixed
- Resolved unchecked errors (errcheck) across the Go API layer.
